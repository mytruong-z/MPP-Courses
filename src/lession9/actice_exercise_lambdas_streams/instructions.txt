The problems to solve are in package named, pipeline, in startup-code folder.

The classes you will query, like Employee and Address etc., are all contained
in the quizclasses package. Test data is created in the two "test data"
classes in that package -- to get test data, call either getList (on EmployeeTestData)
or getTransactions (on TraderTransactTestData).

In the pipeline package, there is a file named, lesson9.demo.actice_exercise_lambdas_streams.pipeline.Main.java. It contains 3 problems in the form
of methods prob1(), prob2(), prob3(). Each needs to be solved with
a pipeline of stream operations, only; the requirement and instructions for each are in the comments above each method.

At the top of the main method you will see a solved sample problem.
When you run the main method, it will run the sample and then
execute the methods, prob1(), prob2(), prob3(), that follows.
